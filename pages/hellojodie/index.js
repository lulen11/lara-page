                Hey Jodie, 
                I'm mid-build on this portfolio so I've adapted it a little to share with you now. You already know this but... Hello! My name's Lara Salameh. I'm a frontend designer and I'm looking for new opportunities.

                <Paragraph>
                For the past 10 years between marketing agencies, freelance, and a not-for-profit, Iâ€™ve worked in what I think is a pretty special middle-ground between design & development.

                As a frontend designer, I spend my days collaborating with great teams to design user experiences and then bring those designs to life through frontend code. My specialities are UX design and frontend development, with lots of experience in web, app & product design, branding, seo and start-up consulting.

Following this build, I went on to planning marketing. </p>

To get the product on the market as soon as possible, I designed the app structure and built a web-modal application, disguised in an app.</p>

This UX process was highly involved as the company was rebranding a 48 year brand identity. </p>

Then went onto build relationships with roasters &amp; subscribers alike. I've since sold this business. </p>
